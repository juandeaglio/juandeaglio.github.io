                        This is my personal project. I spent about 2-3 months working on it. It is a book store website where you can search and purchase books.
                        I built it with Django and React and I deploy it to production with an Nginx webserver and Gunicorn appserver in the backend, with React
                        running in the frontend.

                        It's been more of a learning experience of how to build a full stack application and create a workflow to deploy it to production with automated
                        testing. My familiarity with Python made it more comfortable to learn the unique challenges of creating a Django backend, it also 
                        helped me with quickly picking up the typing system of JavaScript, and in turn, the React framework. The repository is currently public. See for yourself!

                        I worked at AVC Technologies for about 1.5 years.
                        I was responsible for the health of the database and the application. I was also responsible for the health of the servers that the application ran on.            This was expected of me, but I also did more than that.
                        I wrote many, many, SQL queries and Shell scripts.
                        Scripts needed to be maintained, written, and re-written. Ones that frequently monitored the health of our Kubernetes clusters in production.
                        Monitoring our complex microservice architecture, I explored ways of interpreting RabbitMQ logs and Kubernetes logs to show issues in our system.
                        And all of those scripts send their results to a MySQL database hosted in Azure. 
                        I became very familiar with Linux in a distributed system environment.

                    <p class="item_description">
                        I also frequently implemented and used our extensive REST API to correct issues in production.
                        We frequently used Postman to call Microservice APIs, sometimes to lookup a customer's day, sometimes
                        to make new changes to their data and fix issues with temporary workarounds.

                        Overall, I learned a lot of skills and understanding of how a distributed system might get put together and
                        neat tricks to get the most out of simple tools.
