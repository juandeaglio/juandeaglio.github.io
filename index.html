                        Book Haven is my personal project. I spent since July 2023 working on it and learning Django 
                        and React. It is a book store website where you can search and purchase books.
                        I deploy it to production with an Nginx webserver and Gunicorn appserver in the backend,
                        with React running in the frontend.

                        It's been more of a learning experience of how to build a full stack application and create a 
                        workflow to deploy it to production with automated testing. My familiarity with Python made 
                        it more comfortable to learn the unique challenges of creating a Django backend, it also 
                        helped me with quickly picking up the typing system of JavaScript, and in turn, the React 
                        framework. The repository is currently public. See for yourself!

                        My most recent work:
                    </p>
                    <p class="item_description">
                        I worked at AVC Technologies for about 1.5 years.
                        I was responsible for the health of the database and the application. I was also responsible for the health of the servers that the application ran on.            This was expected of me, but I also did more than that.
                        I wrote many, many, SQL queries and Shell scripts.
                        Scripts needed to be maintained, written, and re-written. Ones that frequently monitored the health of our Kubernetes clusters in production.
                        Monitoring our complex microservice architecture, I explored ways of interpreting RabbitMQ logs and Kubernetes logs to show issues in our system.
                        And all of those scripts send their results to a MySQL database hosted in Azure. 
                        I became very familiar with Linux in a distributed system environment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="item_description">
                        I also frequently implemented and used our extensive REST API to correct issues in production.
                        We frequently used Postman to call Microservice APIs, sometimes to lookup a customer's day, sometimes
                        to make new changes to their data and fix issues with temporary workarounds.

                        Overall, I learned a lot of skills and understanding of how a distributed system might get put together and
                        neat tricks to get the most out of simple tools.
